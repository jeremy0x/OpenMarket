                              These contracts help protect all parties involved
                              by not releasing all funds until said terms are
                              agreed on by all, thereby reducing fraud and
                              building trust. The system is necessary in
                              bringing cryptocurrencies into everyday
                              transactions online. Built in Rust on Solana.

                              DAIOs would make sure protocol decisions and
                              disputes are fair and ensure proper
                              accountability. This would be part of the
                              reimagination of the best practice in
                              decentralised governance. Where DAOs lack
                              efficiency, DAIOs deliver it. Built from the
                              ground up.
